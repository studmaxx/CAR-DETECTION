# Car-Detection-Basic-Open-CV

This is my attempt for the first time in object detection i.e. car in this case.
I have developed a python script with OpenCV libraries and using HAAR CASCADE ML algorithm.XML file for the same is uploaded in the repo.

Different videos has been tested and it works fine.
Any modifications is highly welcomed!!
